# Traffic Sign Recognition
 

## Overview
This project focuses on recognizing traffic signals using a deep learning approach. The model is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and leverages libraries like NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch, and Matplotlib. The goal was to optimize efficiency and minimize errors through iterative training processes, selecting the best model after multiple epochs.
