# Traffic Sign Recognition
 

##This project implements a Traffic Sign Recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images of traffic signs. The aim is to build an automated system that accurately recognizes and classifies various traffic signs from images, contributing to the development of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles.

### Problem Statement
Traffic signs are critical for ensuring road safety as they convey essential information to drivers. An automated recognition system can help improve safety and efficiency on the roads. For example, a system should recognize a "Stop" sign and alert the driver to stop the vehicle, thereby preventing accidents.
## Datasets
The dataset used for this project is the **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)**. It contains over 50,000 images categorized into 43 classes of traffic signs.
